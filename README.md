  - React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
  - Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
  - Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests
  - React Router: Declarative routing for React applications

- Backend:
  - Flask: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python
  - SQLAlchemy: SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for Python
  - Flask-RESTful: An extension for Flask that adds support for quickly building REST APIs
  - Celery: An asynchronous task queue/job queue based on distributed message passing
  - Redis: An in-memory data structure store, used as a message broker for Celery
  - Google's Generative AI (Gemini): Used for AI-powered documentation generation

- Database:
  - PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system

- Development and Testing:
  - pytest: A framework for writing small, readable tests in Python
  - ESLint: A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns in JavaScript code

- Deployment and DevOps:
  - Docker: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers
  - Gunicorn: A Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX, used to run the Flask application in production
  - Nginx: A web server used as a reverse proxy for Gunicorn

## Setup and Installation

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/codebase.git
   cd codebase/backend
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Database Configuration

1. Install PostgreSQL if not already installed.
2. Create a new database for the project.
3. Update the `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file with your database credentials.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:

```
FLASK_APP=app
FLASK_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost/codebase
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory with:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/v1
```

## Running the Server

1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd backend
   flask run
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

## API Endpoints

- POST `/api/v1/signup`: Create a new user account
- POST `/api/v1/login`: Authenticate and receive access token
- POST `/api/v1/refresh`: Refresh access token
- POST `/api/v1/generate_key`: Generate a new API key
- POST `/api/v1/gather`: Gather code snippets from various sources
- GET `/api/v1/data`: Retrieve user's code snippets
- GET `/api/v1/documentation`: Generate documentation for code snippets
- GET `/api/v1/documentation/<id>`: Retrieve documentation for a specific snippet
- GET `/api/v1/search`: Search for code snippets
- POST `/api/v1/submit`: Submit code or repository for documentation
- POST `/api/v1/submit-correction`: Submit a correction for existing documentation

## Authentication

The system uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. Include the token in the Authorization header for protected routes.

## Models

- User
- CodeSnippet
- Documentation
- Project
- APIKey

## AI-Powered Documentation Generation

CodeBase uses Google's Generative AI (Gemini) model to generate comprehensive documentation for submitted code snippets and repositories.

## Code Explorer

The Code Explorer feature allows users to browse, search, and view documentation for various code snippets and repositories.

## User Dashboard

The dashboard provides an overview of user-submitted snippets, documentation status, and options to manage API keys.

## API Key Generation

Users can generate API keys for integrating CodeBase with their CI/CD pipelines or other external services.

## Search Functionality

CodeBase offers a powerful search feature to find relevant code snippets based on various criteria such as language, keywords, and stars.

## Pagination

All list views (e.g., code snippets, search results) are paginated to ensure efficient loading and browsing of large datasets.

## Error Handling and Logging

The application implements comprehensive error handling and logging to facilitate debugging and improve user experience.

## Testing

To run the tests:

```
cd backend
pytest
```

## Deployment

To deploy CodeBase, we'll use Docker for containerization and deploy it to a cloud platform. Here are the steps for deploying to a generic cloud platform:

1. Ensure you have Docker installed on your local machine and the deployment server.

2. Create a `Dockerfile` in the root directory of your project:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.9-slim-buster

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 5000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 5000

# Define environment variable
ENV FLASK_APP=app

# Run gunicorn when the container launches
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:5000", "wsgi:app"]
```

3. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    env_file:
      - .env
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=codebase
      - POSTGRES_USER=username
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

4. Build and run your Docker containers:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

5. For production deployment, you'll need to set up a reverse proxy using Nginx. Create an `nginx.conf` file:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://web:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

6. Update your `docker-compose.yml` to include Nginx:

```yaml
services:
  # ... other services ...
  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
    depends_on:
      - web
```

7. Deploy to your chosen cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean) by setting up a virtual machine, installing Docker and Docker Compose, and running your containers.

8. Set up SSL/TLS for secure HTTPS connections using a service like Let's Encrypt.

Remember to never commit your `.env` file to version control. Instead, set up environment variables securely on your deployment platform.

For specific deployment instructions for platforms like Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, or Google Cloud Run, please refer to their respective documentation as the process may vary.

## Project Overview
Tishya is designed to power a social networking platform. It provides robust functionality for user management, social interactions, project collaboration, and institutional affiliations.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend:**
  - Node.js: JavaScript runtime
  - Express: Web application framework
  - Apollo Server: GraphQL server
  - PostgreSQL: Relational database
  - Sequelize: ORM for database interactions
  - JSON Web Tokens (JWT): For authentication
  - bcrypt: For password hashing

- **Development and Testing:**
  - Jest: JavaScript testing framework
  - ESLint: JavaScript linting utility

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Harmeek-19/Tishya.git
   cd social-network-backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Database Configuration
1. Install PostgreSQL if not already installed.
2. Create a new database for the project.
3. Update the `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file with your database credentials.

## Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```
PORT=4000
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost/social_network_db
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_refresh_secret
```

## Running the Server
Start the server in development mode:
```
npm run dev
```
The GraphQL playground will be available at `http://localhost:4000/graphql`.

## API Endpoints
The GraphQL API provides the following main operations:
- User management (signup, login, profile updates)
- Post creation and interaction (comments, likes)
- Project management
- Institution management
- User connections
- Feed generation

For a full list of queries and mutations, refer to the GraphQL schema or use the GraphQL Playground.

## Authentication
The system uses JWT for authentication. Include the token in the Authorization header for protected routes.

## Models
- User
- Post
- Comment
- Like
- Project
- Institution
- Connection

## User Management
- User registration and authentication
- Profile management
- Role-based access control

## Social Interactions
